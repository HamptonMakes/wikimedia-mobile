    # UUID Type
    # First run at this, because I need it. A few caveats:
    #  * Only works on postgres, using the built-in native uuid type.
    #    To make it work in mysql, you'll have to add a typemap entry to
    #    the mysql_adapter. I think. I don't have mysql handy, so I'm
    #    not going to try. For SQLite, this will have to inherit from the
    #    String primitive
    #  * Won't accept a random default, because of the namespace clash
    #    between this and the UUIDtools gem. Also can't set the default
    #    type to UUID() (postgres-contrib's native generator) and
    #    automigrate, because auto_migrate! tries to make it a string "UUID()"
    # Feel free to enchance this, and delete these caveats when they're fixed.

    # Actually, setting the primitive to "UUID" is not neccessary and causes
    # a segfault when trying to query uuid's from the database.  The primitive
    # should be a class which has been added to the do driver you are using.
    # Also, it's only neccessary to add a class to the do drivers to use as a
    # primitive when a value cannot be represented as a string.  A uuid can be
    # represented as a string, so setting the primitive to String ensures that
    # the value argument is a String containing the uuid in string form.
    #
    # <strike>It is still neccessary to add the UUID entry to the type map for
    # each different adapter with their respective database primitive.</strike>
    #
    # The method that generates the SQL schema from the typemap currently
    # ignores the size attribute from the type map if the primitive type
    # is String.  The causes the generated SQL statement to contain a size for
    # a UUID column (e.g. id UUID(50)), which causes a syntax error in postgres.
    # Until this is resolved, you will have to manually change the column type
    # to UUID in a migration, if you want to use postgres' built in UUID type.
