module Merb::Cache
  # A strategy store wraps one or
  # more fundamental stores, acting as a middle man between caching
  # requests.
  #
  # For example, if you need to save memory on your Memcache server,
  # you could wrap your MemcachedStore with a GzipStore. This would
  # automatically compress the cached data when put into the cache, and
  # decompress it on the way out. You can even wrap strategy caches
  # with other strategy caches. If your key was comprised of sensitive
  # information, like a SSN, you might want to encrypt the key before
  # storage. Wrapping your GzipStore in a SHA1Store would take
  # care of that for you.
  #
  # The AbstractStore class defines 9 methods as the API:
  # 
  # writable?(key, parameters = {}, conditions = {})
  # exists?(key, parameters = {})
  # read(key, parameters = {})
  # write(key, data = nil, parameters = {}, conditions = {})
  # write_all(key, data = nil, parameters = {}, conditions = {})
  # fetch(key, parameters = {}, conditions = {}, &blk)
  # delete(key, parameters = {})
  # delete_all
  # delete_all!
  # 
  # AbstractStrategyStore implements all of these with the exception
  # of delete_all. If a strategy store can guarantee that calling
  # delete_all on itâ€™s wrapped store(s) will only delete entries
  # populated by the strategy store, it may define the safe
  # version of delete_all. However, this is usually not the
  # case, hence delete_all is not part of the
  # public API for AbstractStrategyStore.
