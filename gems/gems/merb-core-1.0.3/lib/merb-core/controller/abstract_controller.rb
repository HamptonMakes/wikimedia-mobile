# ==== Why do we use Underscores?
# In Merb, views are actually methods on controllers. This provides
# not-insignificant speed benefits, as well as preventing us from
# needing to copy over instance variables, which we think is proof
# that everything belongs in one class to begin with.
#
# Unfortunately, this means that view helpers need to be included
# into the <strong>Controller</strong> class. To avoid causing confusion
# when your helpers potentially conflict with our instance methods,
# we use an _ to disambiguate. As long as you don't begin your helper
# methods with _, you only need to worry about conflicts with Merb
# methods that are part of the public API.
#
#
#
# ==== Filters
# #before is a class method that allows you to specify before filters in
# your controllers. Filters can either be a symbol or string that
# corresponds to a method name to call, or a proc object. if it is a method
# name that method will be called and if it is a proc it will be called
# with an argument of self where self is the current controller object.
# When you use a proc as a filter it needs to take one parameter.
# 
# #after is identical, but the filters are run after the action is invoked.
#
# ===== Examples
#   before :some_filter
#   before :authenticate, :exclude => [:login, :signup]
#   before :has_role, :with => ["Admin"], :exclude => [:index, :show]
#   before Proc.new { some_method }, :only => :foo
#   before :authorize, :unless => :logged_in?  
#
# You can use either <code>:only => :actionname</code> or 
# <code>:exclude => [:this, :that]</code> but not both at once. 
# <code>:only</code> will only run before the listed actions and 
# <code>:exclude</code> will run for every action that is not listed.
#
# Merb's before filter chain is very flexible. To halt the filter chain you
# use <code>throw :halt</code>. If <code>throw</code> is called with only one 
# argument of <code>:halt</code> the return value of the method 
# <code>filters_halted</code> will be what is rendered to the view. You can 
# override <code>filters_halted</code> in your own controllers to control what 
# it outputs. But the <code>throw</code> construct is much more powerful than 
# just that.
#
# <code>throw :halt</code> can also take a second argument. Here is what that 
# second argument can be and the behavior each type can have:
#
# * +String+:
#   when the second argument is a string then that string will be what
#   is rendered to the browser. Since merb's <code>#render</code> method returns
#   a string you can render a template or just use a plain string:
#
#     throw :halt, "You don't have permissions to do that!"
#     throw :halt, render(:action => :access_denied)
#
# * +Symbol+:
#   If the second arg is a symbol, then the method named after that
#   symbol will be called
#
#     throw :halt, :must_click_disclaimer
#
# * +Proc+:
#   If the second arg is a Proc, it will be called and its return
#   value will be what is rendered to the browser:
#
#     throw :halt, proc { access_denied }
#     throw :halt, proc { Tidy.new(c.index) }
#
# ===== Filter Options (.before, .after, .add_filter, .if, .unless)
# :only<Symbol, Array[Symbol]>::
#   A list of actions that this filter should apply to
#
# :exclude<Symbol, Array[Symbol]::
#   A list of actions that this filter should *not* apply to
# 
# :if<Symbol, Proc>::
#   Only apply the filter if the method named after the symbol or calling the proc evaluates to true
# 
# :unless<Symbol, Proc>::
#   Only apply the filter if the method named after the symbol or calling the proc evaluates to false
#
# :with<Array[Object]>::
#   Arguments to be passed to the filter. Since we are talking method/proc calls,
#   filter method or Proc should to have the same arity
#   as number of elements in Array you pass to this option.
#
# ===== Types (shortcuts for use in this file)
# Filter:: <Array[Symbol, (Symbol, String, Proc)]>
#
# ==== params[:action] and params[:controller] deprecated
# <code>params[:action]</code> and <code>params[:controller]</code> have been deprecated as of
# the 0.9.0 release. They are no longer set during dispatch, and
# have been replaced by <code>action_name</code> and <code>controller_name</code> respectively.
