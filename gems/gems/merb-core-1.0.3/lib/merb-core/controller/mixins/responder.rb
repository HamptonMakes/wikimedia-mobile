module Merb
  # The ResponderMixin adds methods that help you manage what
  # formats your controllers have available, determine what format(s)
  # the client requested and is capable of handling, and perform
  # content negotiation to pick the proper content format to
  # deliver.
  # 
  # If you hear someone say "Use provides" they're talking about the
  # Responder.  If you hear someone ask "What happened to respond_to?"
  # it was replaced by provides and the other Responder methods.
  # 
  # == A simple example
  # 
  # The best way to understand how all of these pieces fit together is
  # with an example.  Here's a simple web-service ready resource that
  # provides a list of all the widgets we know about.  The widget list is 
  # available in 3 formats: :html (the default), plus :xml and :text.
  # 
  #     class Widgets < Application
  #       provides :html   # This is the default, but you can
  #                        # be explicit if you like.
  #       provides :xml, :text
  #       
  #       def index
  #         @widgets = Widget.fetch
  #         render @widgets
  #       end
  #     end
  # 
  # Let's look at some example requests for this list of widgets.  We'll
  # assume they're all GET requests, but that's only to make the examples
  # easier; this works for the full set of RESTful methods.
  # 
  # 1. The simplest case, /widgets.html
  #    Since the request includes a specific format (.html) we know
  #    what format to return.  Since :html is in our list of provided
  #    formats, that's what we'll return.  +render+ will look
  #    for an index.html.erb (or another template format
  #    like index.html.mab; see the documentation on Template engines)
  # 
  # 2. Almost as simple, /widgets.xml
  #    This is very similar.  They want :xml, we have :xml, so
  #    that's what they get.  If +render+ doesn't find an 
  #    index.xml.builder or similar template, it will call +to_xml+
  #    on @widgets.  This may or may not do something useful, but you can 
  #    see how it works.
  #
  # 3. A browser request for /widgets
  #    This time the URL doesn't say what format is being requested, so
  #    we'll look to the HTTP Accept: header.  If it's '*/*' (anything),
  #    we'll use the first format on our list, :html by default.
  #    
  #    If it parses to a list of accepted formats, we'll look through 
  #    them, in order, until we find one we have available.  If we find
  #    one, we'll use that.  Otherwise, we can't fulfill the request: 
  #    they asked for a format we don't have.  So we raise
  #    406: Not Acceptable.
  # 
  # == A more complex example
  # 
  # Sometimes you don't have the same code to handle each available 
  # format. Sometimes you need to load different data to serve
  # /widgets.xml versus /widgets.txt.  In that case, you can use
  # +content_type+ to determine what format will be delivered.
  # 
  #     class Widgets < Application
  #       def action1
  #         if content_type == :text
  #           Widget.load_text_formatted(params[:id])
  #         else
  #           render
  #         end
  #       end
  #       
  #       def action2
  #         case content_type
  #         when :html
  #           handle_html()
  #         when :xml
  #           handle_xml()
  #         when :text
  #           handle_text()
  #         else
  #           render
  #         end
  #       end
  #     end
  # 
  # You can do any standard Ruby flow control using +content_type+.  If
  # you don't call it yourself, it will be called (triggering content
  # negotiation) by +render+.
  #
  # Once +content_type+ has been called, the output format is frozen,
  # and none of the provides methods can be used.
