  # ==== Parameters
  # *names<Array[Symbol]>::
  #   an Array of method names that should be overridable in application
  #   controllers.
  # 
  # ==== Returns
  # Array:: The list of methods that are overridable

  # :api: plugin

  # In an application controller, call override! before a method to indicate
  # that you want to override a method in Merb::Controller that is not
  # normally overridable.
  #
  # Doing this may potentially break your app in a future release of Merb,
  # and this is provided for users who are willing to take that risk.
  # Without using override!, Merb will raise an error if you attempt to
  # override a method defined on Merb::Controller.
  #
  # This is to help users avoid a common mistake of defining an action
  # that overrides a core method on Merb::Controller.
  #
  # ==== Parameters
  # *names<Array[Symbol]>:: 
  #   An Array of methods that will override Merb core classes on purpose
  #
  # ==== Example
  #     
  #     class Kontroller < Application
  #       def status
  #         render
  #       end
  #     end
  # 
  # will raise a Merb::ReservedError, because #status is a method on
  # Merb::Controller.
  # 
  #     class Kontroller < Application
  #       override! :status
  #       def status
  #         some_code || super
  #       end
  #     end
  #
  # will not raise a Merb::ReservedError, because the user specifically
  # decided to override the status method.

  # ==== Parameters

  # ==== Parameters

  #
  # ==== Returns
  # Array[String]::
  #   An array of actions that should be dispatched to even if they would not
  #   otherwise be.
  #
  # ==== Example
  #   module Foo
  #     def self.included(base)
  #       base.show_action(:foo)
  #     end

  #     def foo

  end

  # The list of actions that are callable, after taking defaults,

  # ==== Parameters
  # context<~to_s>:: The name of the action or template basename that will be rendered.
  # type<~to_s>::
  #    The mime-type of the template that will be rendered. Defaults to nil.
