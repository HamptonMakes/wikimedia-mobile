  # Router stores route definitions and finds the first
  # route that matches the incoming request URL.
  # 
  # Then information from route is used by dispatcher to
  # call action on the controller.
  # 
  # ==== Routes compilation.
  # 
  # The most interesting method of Router (and heart of
  # route matching machinery) is match method generated
  # on the fly from routes definitions. It is called routes
  # compilation. Generated match method body contains
  # one if/elsif statement that picks the first matching route
  # definition and sets values to named parameters of the route.
  # 
  # Compilation is synchronized by mutex.

      # A hash of all the application resource routes. The key of the hash

      # for example, given the following resource routes:
      #
      # resources :users do

      # The starting point for route definition. Any route defined in a
      # Merb::Router.prepare block will defined in context of this 
      # behavior.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #
      # Merb::Router.root_behavior = Merb::Router.root_bavior.match("/hello")
      #
      # In the previous example, all routes will have the path prefix /hello.
      # It is important to note that this attribute must be set before any
      # routes are defined in order for the behavior to be applied to the
      # routes.
      # 
      # :api: plugin
      attr_accessor :root_behavior
      
      # A block that will be run around route matching. This block must yield
      # in order for the actual matching to happen.

      # :api: plugin
      attr_accessor :around_match
      
      # Creates a route building context and evaluates the block in it. A
      # copy of +root_behavior+ (and instance of Behavior) is copied as
      # the context.
      # 
      # ==== Parameters
      # first<Array>::
      #   An array containing routes that should be prepended to the routes
      #   defined in the block.
      # last<Array>::
      #   An array containing routes that should be appended to the routes
      #   defined in the block.

      # There are three possible ways to use this method.  First, if you have a named route,

      # ==== Parameters(Default Route)
      # args<Hash>::

      # args<Array>::
