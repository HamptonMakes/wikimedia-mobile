  # :include:QUICKLINKS
  #
  # = Properties
  # Properties for a model are not derived from a database structure, but
  # instead explicitly declared inside your model class definitions. These
  # properties then map (or, if using automigrate, generate) fields in your
  # repository/database.
  #
  # If you are coming to DataMapper from another ORM framework, such as
  # ActiveRecord, this is a fundamental difference in thinking. However, there
  # are several advantages to defining your properties in your models:
  #
  # * information about your model is centralized in one place: rather than
  #   having to dig out migrations, xml or other configuration files.
  # * having information centralized in your models, encourages you and the
  #   developers on your team to take a model-centric view of development.
  # * it provides the ability to use Ruby's access control functions.
  # * and, because DataMapper only cares about properties explicitly defined in
  #   your models, DataMapper plays well with legacy databases, and shares
  #   databases easily with other applications.
  #
  # == Declaring Properties
  # Inside your class, you call the property method for each property you want
  # to add. The only two required arguments are the name and type, everything
  # else is optional.
  #
  #   class Post
  #     include DataMapper::Resource
  #     property :title,   String,    :nullable => false
  #        # Cannot be null
  #     property :publish, TrueClass, :default => false
  #        # Default value for new records is false
  #   end
  #
  # By default, DataMapper supports the following primitive types:
  #
  # * TrueClass, Boolean
  # * String
  # * Text (limit of 65k characters by default)
  # * Float
  # * Integer
  # * BigDecimal
  # * DateTime
  # * Date
  # * Time
  # * Object (marshalled out during serialization)
  # * Class (datastore primitive is the same as String. Used for Inheritance)
  #
  # For more information about available Types, see DataMapper::Type
  #
  # == Limiting Access
  # Property access control is uses the same terminology Ruby does. Properties
  # are public by default, but can also be declared private or protected as
  # needed (via the :accessor option).
  #
  #  class Post
  #   include DataMapper::Resource
  #    property :title,  String, :accessor => :private
  #      # Both reader and writer are private
  #    property :body,   Text,   :accessor => :protected
  #      # Both reader and writer are protected
  #  end
  #
  # Access control is also analogous to Ruby accessors and mutators, and can
  # be declared using :reader and :writer, in addition to :accessor.
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #    property :title, String, :writer => :private
  #      # Only writer is private
  #
  #    property :tags,  String, :reader => :protected
  #      # Only reader is protected
  #  end
  #
  # == Overriding Accessors
  # The accessor for any property can be overridden in the same manner that Ruby
  # class accessors can be.  After the property is defined, just add your custom
  # accessor:
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #    property :title,  String
  #
  #    def title=(new_title)
  #      raise ArgumentError if new_title != 'Luke is Awesome'
  #      @title = new_title
  #    end
  #  end
  #
  # == Lazy Loading
  # By default, some properties are not loaded when an object is fetched in
  # DataMapper. These lazily loaded properties are fetched on demand when their
  # accessor is called for the first time (as it is often unnecessary to
  # instantiate -every- property -every- time an object is loaded).  For
  # instance, DataMapper::Types::Text fields are lazy loading by default,
  # although you can over-ride this behavior if you wish:
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #    property :title,  String                    # Loads normally
  #    property :body,   DataMapper::Types::Text   # Is lazily loaded by default
  #  end
  #
  # If you want to over-ride the lazy loading on any field you can set it to a
  # context or false to disable it with the :lazy option. Contexts allow
  # multipule lazy properties to be loaded at one time. If you set :lazy to
  # true, it is placed in the :default context
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #    property :title,    String
  #      # Loads normally
  #
  #    property :body,     DataMapper::Types::Text, :lazy => false
  #      # The default is now over-ridden
  #
  #    property :comment,  String, lazy => [:detailed]
  #      # Loads in the :detailed context
  #
  #    property :author,   String, lazy => [:summary,:detailed]
  #      # Loads in :summary & :detailed context
  #  end
  #
  # Delaying the request for lazy-loaded attributes even applies to objects
  # accessed through associations. In a sense, DataMapper anticipates that
  # you will likely be iterating over objects in associations and rolls all
  # of the load commands for lazy-loaded properties into one request from
  # the database.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   Widget[1].components
  #     # loads when the post object is pulled from database, by default
  #
  #   Widget[1].components.first.body
  #     # loads the values for the body property on all objects in the
  #     # association, rather than just this one.
  #
  #   Widget[1].components.first.comment
  #     # loads both comment and author for all objects in the association
  #     # since they are both in the :detailed context
  #
  # == Keys
  # Properties can be declared as primary or natural keys on a table.
  # You should a property as the primary key of the table:
  #
  # Examples:
  #
  #  property :id,        Serial                    # auto-incrementing key
  #  property :legacy_pk, String, :key => true      # 'natural' key
  #
  # This is roughly equivalent to ActiveRecord's <tt>set_primary_key</tt>,
  # though non-integer data types may be used, thus DataMapper supports natural
  # keys. When a property is declared as a natural key, accessing the object
  # using the indexer syntax <tt>Class[key]</tt> remains valid.
  #
  #   User[1]
  #      # when :id is the primary key on the users table
  #   User['bill']
  #      # when :name is the primary (natural) key on the users table
  #
  # == Indeces
  # You can add indeces for your properties by using the <tt>:index</tt>
  # option. If you use <tt>true</tt> as the option value, the index will be
  # automatically named. If you want to name the index yourself, use a symbol
  # as the value.
  #
  #   property :last_name,  String, :index => true
  #   property :first_name, String, :index => :name
  #
  # You can create multi-column composite indeces by using the same symbol in
  # all the columns belonging to the index. The columns will appear in the
  # index in the order they are declared.
  #
  #   property :last_name,  String, :index => :name
  #   property :first_name, String, :index => :name
  #      # => index on (last_name, first_name)
  #
  # If you want to make the indeces unique, use <tt>:unique_index</tt> instead
  # of <tt>:index</tt>
  #
  # == Inferred Validations
  # If you require the dm-validations plugin, auto-validations will
  # automatically be mixed-in in to your model classes:
  # validation rules that are inferred when properties are declared with
  # specific column restrictions.
  #
  #  class Post
  #    include DataMapper::Resource
  #
  #    property :title, String, :length => 250
  #      # => infers 'validates_length :title,
  #             :minimum => 0, :maximum => 250'
  #
  #    property :title, String, :nullable => false
  #      # => infers 'validates_present :title
  #
  #    property :email, String, :format => :email_address
  #      # => infers 'validates_format :email, :with => :email_address
  #
  #    property :title, String, :length => 255, :nullable => false
  #      # => infers both 'validates_length' as well as
  #      #    'validates_present'
  #      #    better: property :title, String, :length => 1..255
  #
  #  end
  #
  # This functionality is available with the dm-validations gem, part of the
  # dm-more bundle. For more information about validations, check the
  # documentation for dm-validations.
  #
  # == Default Values
  # To set a default for a property, use the <tt>:default</tt> key.  The
  # property will be set to the value associated with that key the first time
  # it is accessed, or when the resource is saved if it hasn't been set with
  # another value already.  This value can be a static value, such as 'hello'
  # but it can also be a proc that will be evaluated when the property is read
  # before its value has been set.  The property is set to the return of the
  # proc.  The proc is passed two values, the resource the property is being set
  # for and the property itself.
  #
  #   property :display_name, String, :default => { |r, p| r.login }
  #
  # Word of warning.  Don't try to read the value of the property you're setting
  # the default for in the proc.  An infinite loop will ensue.
  #
  # == Embedded Values
  # As an alternative to extraneous has_one relationships, consider using an
  # EmbeddedValue.
  #
  # == Misc. Notes
  # * Properties declared as strings will default to a length of 50, rather than
  #   255 (typical max varchar column size).  To overload the default, pass
  #   <tt>:length => 255</tt> or <tt>:length => 0..255</tt>.  Since DataMapper
  #   does not introspect for properties, this means that legacy database tables
  #   may need their <tt>String</tt> columns defined with a <tt>:length</tt> so
  #   that DM does not apply an un-needed length validation, or allow overflow.
  # * You may declare a Property with the data-type of <tt>Class</tt>.
  #   see SingleTableInheritance for more on how to use <tt>Class</tt> columns.
