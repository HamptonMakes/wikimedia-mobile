== TODO

* Change Thor.start to parse ARGV in a single pass
* Improve spec coverage for Thor::Runner
* Improve help output to list shorthand switches, too
* Investigate and fix deep namespacing ("foo:bar:baz") issues

== 0.9.8, released 2008-10-20

* Fixed some tiny issues that were introduced lately.

== 0.9.7, released 2008-10-13

* Setting global method options on the initialize method works as expected:
  All other tasks will accept these global options in addition to their own.
* Added 'group' notion to Thor task sets (class Thor); by default all tasks
  are in the 'standard' group. Running 'thor -T' will only show the standard
  tasks - adding --all will show all tasks. You can also filter on a specific
  group using the --group option: thor -T --group advanced
  
== 0.9.6, released 2008-09-13

* Generic improvements

== 0.9.5, released 2008-08-27

* Improve Windows compatibility
* Update (incorrect) README and task.thor sample file
* Options hash is now frozen (once returned)
* Allow magic predicates on options object. For instance: `options.force?`
* Add support for :numeric type
* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: Refactor Thor::Options. You cannot access shorthand forms in options hash anymore (for instance, options[:f])
* Allow specifying optional args with default values: method_options(:user => "mislav")
* Don't write options for nil or false values. This allows, for example, turning color off when running specs.
* Exit with the status of the spec command to help CI stuff out some.

== 0.9.4, released 2008-08-13

* Try to add Windows compatibility.
* BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE: options hash is now accessed as a property in your class and is not passed as last argument anymore
* Allow options at the beginning of the argument list as well as the end.
* Make options available with symbol keys in addition to string keys.
* Allow true to be passed to Thor#method_options to denote a boolean option.
* If loading a thor file fails, don't give up, just print a warning and keep going.
* Make sure that we re-raise errors if they happened further down the pipe than we care about.
* Only delete the old file on updating when the installation of the new one is a success
* Make it Ruby 1.8.5 compatible.
* Don't raise an error if a boolean switch is defined multiple times.
* Thor::Options now doesn't parse through things that look like options but aren't.
* Add URI detection to install task, and make sure we don't append ".thor" to URIs
* Add rake2thor to the gem binfiles.
* Make sure local Thorfiles override system-wide ones.
