Merb-gen is now ported to templater, instead of rubigen. Some things are left to do, including:

* Integrate with Merb::Config[:framework], so that stuff gets placed in the correct directories
* Allow some system for plugins to add their own generators.
* Move ORM specific templates/code into respective plugin (this requires a change in templater so that absolute paths can be specified for templates)
* Move test_unit stuff into merb-test-unit
* Move part controller generator into merb-parts
* Automatically infer ORM and testing framework (this should be easy, really)
* Add migration generators
* Add generators for session migrations
* Change ActiveRecord migrations to use new datestamp format

* Fix remaining stuff in templater (see separate TODO)
