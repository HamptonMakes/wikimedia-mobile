    # Creates a new migration, and adds it to the list of migrations to be run.
    # Migrations can be defined in any order, they will be sorted and run in the
    # correct order.
    #
    # The order that migrations are run in is set by the first argument. It is not
    # neccessary that this be unique; migrations with the same version number are
    # expected to be able to be run in any order.
    #
    # The second argument is the name of the migration. This name is used internally
    # to track if the migration has been run. It is required that this name be unique
    # across all migrations.
    #
    # Addtionally, it accepts a number of options:
    # * <tt>:database</tt> If you defined several DataMapper::database instances use this
    #   to choose which one to run the migration gagainst. Defaults to <tt>:default</tt>.
    #   Migrations are tracked individually per database.
    # * <tt>:verbose</tt> true/false, defaults to true. Determines if the migration should
    #   output its status messages when it runs.
    #
    # Example of a simple migration:
    #
    #   migration( 1, :create_people_table ) do
    #     up do
    #       create_table :people do
    #         column :id,     Integer, :serial => true
    #         column :name,   String, :size => 50
    #         column :age,    Integer
    #       end
    #     end
    #     down do
    #       drop_table :people
    #     end

    # Its recommended that you stick with raw SQL for migrations that manipulate data. If
    # you write a migration using a model, then later change the model, there's a
    # possibility the migration will no longer work. Using SQL will always work.
