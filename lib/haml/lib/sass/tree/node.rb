module Sass
  # A namespace for nodes in the Sass parse tree.
  #
  # The Sass parse tree has two states.
  # When it's first parsed, it has nodes for mixin definitions
  # and for loops and so forth,
  # in addition to nodes for CSS rules and properties.
  #
  # However, {Tree::Node#perform} returns a different sort of tree.
  # This tree maps more closely to the resulting CSS document
  # than it does to the original Sass document.
  # It still has nodes for CSS rules and properties,
  # but it doesn't have any dynamic-generation-related nodes.
  #
  # Nodes that only appear in the pre-perform state are called **dynamic nodes**;
  # those that appear in both states are called **static nodes**.

    # and the superclass of all other parse-tree nodes.
